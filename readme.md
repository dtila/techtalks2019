# How to get sarted with Digital Trends
I am sure you have all heard that Digital transformation is here. So there is no news that Stefanini sustains as well this digital revolution and has the Digital Transformation Center department for this. We help customers emerge to the next software technologies and trends and make each day a step closer to the complete digitalization. 
However, what these mean Want to get start using latest trends, checkout a few tips and tricks:

## Design thinking
Design Thinking is an iterative process in which we seek to understand the user.

At the same time, Design Thinking provides a solution-based approach to solving problems. It is a way of thinking and working as well as a collection of hands-on methods.

It's more focused on business development and does not involve any programming language. Have a look at [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0V5BwTrQOCs) introduction video.

## Augmented Reality
[PokemonGO](https://www.pokemongo.com/en-us/) is one of the famous games with augmented reality.
You can quickly start developing AR applications with [Unity3D](https://unity3d.com/unity) engine and you need to have some basic knowledge of the C# programming laugage first. 
It's free for personal usage and very popular in the community. They have a few free tutorials from the [official](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials) page and you can find plenty more on Youtube.

You can target [mobile phone](https://unity.com/solutions/mobile-ar) to develop AR applications or [vuforia](https://www.vuforia.com/) to develop on specialized hardware based like [HoloLens](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens).

## Blockchain
Blockchain is a network of devices that run shared code (named [Smart Contracts](https://www.coursera.org/learn/smarter-contracts)) that maintains a the  protocol trusted by everyone and it manage the flow of operation that needs to be done to perform a transaction on the network.

Each block is linked with data from a previous node from the network. 
In the software industry, blockchain can used in the:
- healthcare (to trust your medical file history)
- real estate (ensure a clean record of ownership)
- learning (certify the diplomas)
- enterprise (to store data securely )
- advertising (providing an ads marketing for publishers)

Get started with [Smart Contracts](https://www.coursera.org/learn/smarter-contracts) and learn how you [develop and deploy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58yeu6HtzpM) your first Smart Contract on the Ethereum network. 

## Machine Learning
Machine Learning is a method of solving problems using statistical models in computer systems without using explicit instructions.
The effective solving is made relying on patterns and inference instead. Instead of finding the explicit instruction, we find properties that can be used as a trained data and recognised along with the actual context later.
Solving a problem with ML does not mean that you solve 100% of the cases (mostly). The accuracy increase as long the trained data increases.

- Learn about [Natural Language Processing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQQ-W_63UgQ&list=PL3FW7Lu3i5Jsnh1rnUwq_TcylNr7EkRe6) and how you train a neural network on texts

## Chatbots
A chatbot is a simulated human to allow discussions using normal conversation methods: voice, chat. The first chatbot was [Eliza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA) created in 1964. It was released as a desktop application and the interaction was over text.
Modern chatbots like Google Home, Alexa or Siri are able to communicate using voice and able to give answers that are depending on the context of the conversation.
To get started to develop a chatbot, you need:
- inspiration :)
- a communication channel (Facebook, Slack, Google Home, etc)
- interstanding intent ([Rasa](https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa_core), [Dialogflow](https://dialogflow.com))
- learn how you [build a great user experience](https://developers.google.com/actions/design/) 

At Stefanini we use [Sophie](https://stefanini.com/en/solutions/products/sophie) as a product for createing a great business experience. Sophie is already trained for corporate specific tasks and it's already trained for conversations in a such environment.

## Robotic Process Automation
Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is technology used to automate human repetitive tasks that have enought maturity and used frequently. It is a program that is used to automate software [user interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface) that are used on a daily routine. It can identify actions, triggers and issue human interactions (clicks, keyboards) just like a real person does.
The big advantage is that it's no error prone and is easy to integrate with external systems.

There are a few major players in this are, like:
- [UiPath](https://www.uipath.com/) offers an open platform to help organizations efficiently automate business processes
- [BluePrism](https://www.blueprism.com/) focuses on providing organizations in regulated industries with more agile virtual workforces
- [Automation Anywhere](https://www.automationanywhere.com/) provides an enterprise digital workforce platform geared toward procure-to-pay, quote-to-cash, HR, claims processing and other back-office processes

Stefanini is a gold partner with UiPath and we use along with our certified developers as a trust platform to create human robots.

Get started with the [UiPath arhitecture](https://www.guru99.com/uipath-tutorial.html) and learning using the [official UiPath channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-UoYmRvsKw&list=PLG3LgE4atuv_XaxeyYNjvGVaCmi0rE9ho) or other [free online](https://cloudfoundation.com/uipath-training/) courses.
