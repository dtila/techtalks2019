# Digital Trends and UX
I am sure you have all heard that Digital transformation is here. So there is no news that Stefanini sustains as well this digital revolution and has a dedicated department for this. What help customers emerge to the next software technologies and trends and making each day a step closer to the complete digitalization. 
We are playing with:

## Design thinking
Design Thinking is a design methodology that provides a solution-based approach to solving problems. It’s extremely useful in tackling complex problems that are ill-defined or unknown, by understanding the human needs involved, by re-framing the problem in human-centric ways, by creating many ideas in brainstorming sessions, and by adopting a hands-on approach in prototyping and testing.
It's more focused on business development and does not involve any programming language. Have a look at [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0V5BwTrQOCs) introduction video.

## Augmented Reality
[PokemonGO](https://www.pokemongo.com/en-us/) is one of the famous games with augmented reality.
You can quickly start developing AR applications with [Unity3D](https://unity3d.com/unity) engine and you need to have some basic knowledge of the C# programming laugage first. 
It's free for personal usage and very popular in the community. They have a few free tutorials from the [official](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials) page and you can find plenty more on Youtube.

You can target [mobile phone](https://unity.com/solutions/mobile-ar) to develop AR applications or [vuforia](https://www.vuforia.com/) to develop on specialized hardware based like [HoloLens](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens).

## Blockchain
Blockchain is a list of records that are used in a cryptography scenario. Users can link blocks of information to sign previus already signed information and build a trusted network of communication.
In the software industry, blockchain is used in the:
- healthcare (to trust your medical file history)
- real estate (nsure a clean record of ownership)
- learning (certify the diplomas)
- enterprise (to store data securely )
- advertising (providing an ads marketing for publishers)

The most flexible usage of blockchain is the usage of [Smart Contracts](https://www.coursera.org/learn/smarter-contracts). These needs to run on a network that supports (typically Ethereum Network). The hole process of having a smart contract up and running is explained [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58yeu6HtzpM). 

## Machine Learning
Machine learning is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to effectively perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead.
Improve your skills:
- [Introduction](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) with mathematical definitions
- [Getting started](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python) with Machine Learning applied using Python
- Learn about [Natural Language Processing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQQ-W_63UgQ&list=PL3FW7Lu3i5Jsnh1rnUwq_TcylNr7EkRe6) and how you train a neural network on texts

## Chatbots
A chatbot (also known as a smartbot, conversational bot, chatterbot, interactive agent, conversational interface, Conversational AI, or artificial conversational entity) is a computer program or an artificial intelligence which conducts a conversation via auditory or textual methods.
It's hard to do a mimic a human interaction with a bot, but there is a good guideline by Google where you can learn how to [build a great user experience](https://developers.google.com/actions/design/) conversation.
We, at Stefanini we use [Sophie](https://stefanini.com/en/solutions/products/sophie) as a core product and personalize per each client needs.
Curious about how you build yourself a bot? You need to understand a few notions about how the fulfillment works [here](https://itnext.io/building-a-chatbot-with-rasa-9c3f3c6ad64d) and [Rasa](https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa_core) is a open source NLP engine to help building a chat. 

## Robotic Process Automation
Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is an emerging technology aimed to replace human interaction for processes which have a mature development and are repetitive. Combined with AI, can detect and fulfill similar with a human an existing system.
RPA does not need an application programing interface(API) to communicate with the systems they automate, it’s looks at the way that a human perform the task and simulate the actions  directly in the graphical user interface(GUI), just as a human would do available 24/7.
There are a few major players in this are, like:
- [UiPath](https://www.uipath.com/) offers an open platform to help organizations efficiently automate business processes
- [BluePrism](https://www.blueprism.com/) focuses on providing organizations in regulated industries with more agile virtual workforces
- [Automation Anywhere](https://www.automationanywhere.com/) provides an enterprise digital workforce platform geared toward procure-to-pay, quote-to-cash, HR, claims processing and other back-office processes

Stefanini is a gold partner with UiPath and we use along with our certified developers as a trust platform to create human robots.
### Getting started
There is a [good](https://www.guru99.com/uipath-tutorial.html) article where explains the architecture of UiPath solution. You can start learning using the [official UiPath channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-UoYmRvsKw&list=PLG3LgE4atuv_XaxeyYNjvGVaCmi0rE9ho) or other [free online](https://cloudfoundation.com/uipath-training/) courses.
